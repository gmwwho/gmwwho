- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmwwho
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, GIS for ArcGis Pro + QGIS, sUAS flight, and SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate Python, ArcPy/pandas + Geopandas/ numpy/ matplotlib/ some CV2, PostGreSQL + PostGIS
- 💞️ I’m looking to get an internship or a mentorship for programming for GIS and drone flight. In school for a GIS certificate now.
- My current projecta are:
1) programming DJI Tello drone for planned flight paths, manual control, and face tracking.
2) developing tools in Python and ArcPy which can be imported into ArcGIS Pro
