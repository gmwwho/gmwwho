- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmwwho
- 👀 I’m interested in SQL and Python for GIS, LiDAR processing, and creating workflows
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate Python, Geopandas, PDAL, ArcPy, Spatial SQL
- 💞️ Presently working as a Lidar Analyst, expanding my skills in CADD, scripting, and all things point cloud.

- My current projects are:
1) working through PDAL tutorials to better understand the workflow I use professionally
2) developing Python and bash scipts to automate processes
3) continually learning about the complexities of airborne lidar collection
