- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmwwho
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, GIS for ArcGis Pro + QGIS, sUAS flight, and SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning just about everything: intermediate Python, pandas/ numpy/ matplotlib
- 💞️ I’m looking to get a mentorship for programming for GIS and drone flight. In school for a GIS certificate now.
