- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmwwho
- 👀 I’m interested in SQL and Python for GIS, LiDAR processing, and creating workflows
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate Python, PDAL, ArcPy, Spatial SQL, Geopandas
- 💞️ Presently working as a Lidar tech, expanding my skills in CADD, scripting, and all things point cloud.

- My current projects are:
1) working through PDAL tutorials to better understand the workflow I use professionally
2) developing Python and bash scipts to automate processes, generally within ArcMap
3) automating drone flight paths in Python
4) continually learning about the complexities of airborne lidar collection
