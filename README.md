- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmwwho
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, GIS for ArcGis Pro + QGIS, sUAS flight, and SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate Python, ArcPy/pandas/ numpy/ matplotlib, PostGreSQL + PostGIS
- 💞️ I’m looking to get a mentorship for programming for GIS and drone flight. In school for a GIS certificate now.
- My current project is programming DJI Tello drone for planned flight paths, manual control, and face tracking.
