- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmwwho
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, GIS for ArcGis Pro + QGIS, sUAS flight, and SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate Python, ArcPy/pandas + Geopandas/ numpy/ matplotlib/ some CV2, PostGreSQL + PostGIS
- 💞️ Presently working as a GIS tech, expanding my skills in CADD, programming, and GIS.
- My current projects are:
1) programming DJI Tello drone for planned flight paths, manual control, and face tracking.
2) developing tools in Python and ArcPy which can be imported into ArcGIS Pro
3) working on small, fun projects in Python
